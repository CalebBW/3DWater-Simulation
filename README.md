# 3DWater-Simulation
Real time 3D water simulation on the GPU

This is intended to be a viable solution for people looking for fast, real time water physics in their projects. It uses SFML for context creation, user input, and text display, but does not rely on it for any implementation of the simulation itself. The hope is that the code in this standalone executable are easily adapted to existing projects without in depth prerequisite knowledge of SFML or OpenGL.
